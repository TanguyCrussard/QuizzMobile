Quizz project for the course "Software Architecture and Mobile Programming" at the University of
Besan√ßon.

## Getting Started

Quizz started to fetch json data from URL and display it in a list in modification page. The user
can click on a question to modify it. To change answer, the user can click on the answer button. The
user can also add a question and answer to the list or delete them by swiping on the question.

To play Quizz, the user can click on the play button at the main page.
